**Philosophy:**

Focusync treats focus as a skill to develop, not a game to win. We believe productivity apps should help you improve, not hook you. Your data stays yours, always.

Perfect for Pomodoro technique users, Deep Work practitioners, and anyone who wants to work with more intention and less stress.

**Privacy & Data:**

Everything stays on your device. No servers, no accounts, no tracking. Export your data anytime. Delete everything with one tap. We can't access your data because we never have it.

Built with calm technology principles - helping you work better without adding to your stress.
